# What is the git repo for?
I created a full tutorial on my substack (anarchosolarpunk.substack.com), which has step by step information about how to use and install these files. 

# Files to make the Tiny Banned Book Library 
Inside this repo is a list of all the commands to quickly copy to your machine, then copy and paste into a terminal to get up and running quickly. 
Also included are the config files needed to get all of this running, and to make it easy to copy and paste, then customize if you want. 

The HTML files for the splash page are in their own separate folder. Modify them however you want.
