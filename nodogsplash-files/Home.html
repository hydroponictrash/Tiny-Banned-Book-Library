        </h1>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-5" spellcheck="false">This digital library hosts books that are being banned or challenged by Republicans, Conservatives, and Christian Nationalists who are actively trying to ban information. People who normally say they are for "free speech" are against people having access to both historical and modern information about a broad range of topics. From LGBTQA+ rights and books about being queer, to the violent history of slavery, Jim Crow, and Black history in general. Trying to ban books that talk about the Japanese internment camps during WWII, or graphic novels about the holocaust. <br>This is a direct attempt to block access to real and accessible information.<br>
        </p>
        <h1 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-6">We have to take a stand.<br>
        </h1>
        <p class="u-align-left u-text u-text-7" spellcheck="false">Information wants to be free, and no person should be denied access to books simply because someone doesn't agree with them. We should allow people to live their lives and be able to read about topics that might resonate with them. We can't ignore history or lie about it. We can't deny the humanity of people by invalidating who they love, or how they identify. We can't allow states, governments, and corporations to lie to people, feeding them misinformation for political gain.&nbsp; And so - in a small way, with a server in hand, someone has decided to share the books that some think should be banned. <br>
